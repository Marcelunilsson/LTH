<h2> Retrospective </h2>
<h4> Iteration 1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make stories smaller so it's easier with pair programming
<li>Work more in pairs than in a group like we have done first week
<li>If you have added something that works, don't forget to push it up so it's not in someone's computer that other people can't access
</ul>

<h4> Iteration 2</h4>
<ul>
<li> During standup meetings: share screen and show progress, if neccessary.
<li> Demonstration at the end of the week for everyone to catch up on what has happened.
<li> Structure of program is unclear, present some sort of diagram/list each iteration of what should be done and how (we're lacking a design phase).
<li> Set up some sort of diagram to help us get an overview of the project.
</ul>

<h4> Iteration 3</h4>
<ul>
<li> Try to avoid "big merges". 
</ul>
